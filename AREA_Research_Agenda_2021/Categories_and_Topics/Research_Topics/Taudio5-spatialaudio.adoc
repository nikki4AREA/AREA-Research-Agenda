# Trade-off and Substitution: Stereoscopic Vision for Spatial Audio

# Description
Stereoscopic vision has long been considered the best type of visualization in terms of matching physical and simulated realities. Producing a perfect 3D visualization and registration of AR assets is not possible using standard AR displays. Solutions that may address the shortcomings of existing AR displays will have a price point that will be prohibitively high and present a financial barrier to AR adoption in enterprises.

By taking advantage of advancements in DSP and audiology, a new class of devices are emerging. Spatially-aware audio transducers can help determine the exact position of posture/pose of the wearer as well as generate simulated sound field that match the physical environment. Such systems need to be combined with existing vision-centric displays for high fidelity enterprise AR experiences.

This topic will include in its scope, measurement of the spatial audio technology resource requirements. Studies will compare spatial audio requirements to vision-only AR experiences on the basis of accuracy, speed, battery life, bandwidth requirements, processor performance, wearer comfort and pricing.
This research topic includes comparative studies of human performance aided by varying blends of spatial technology ranging from “audio-only” to “video-only” and various combinations of both.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Spatial vision makes instinctive sense in a number of situations but it is not always as practical, comfortable or affordable way to produce AR experiences that help reach use case objectives. If performance requirements on vision-based AR delivery can be reduced using spatial audio solution, enterprises may have more options and greater flexibility when sourcing their AR experience delivery devices. In addition, spatial audio-based solutions may lower total resourcing needs, reducing the financial barriers of enterprise adoption.

# Possible Methodologies
Series of experiments potentially scaled up to  time-motion studies using standardized, public and well-documented processes typical of industry verticals, use cases and horizontal use case categories.
